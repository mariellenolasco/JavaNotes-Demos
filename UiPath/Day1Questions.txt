    ~%50% Rules-driven
    ~%50% Repetitive in nature
    ~%0% Driven by manual inputs
    ~%0% Extremely complex and difficult
}

::Robot Types::
Which statement best describes the two robot types{
    ~Attendant robots are called so because they function as robot assistants and ease their human's workload. Non attendant robots are called so because they function independently from humans.
    ~Attended robots are called so because you have to attend a seminar to learn how to work with them. Unattended robots function separate from humans and require no seminar training.
    ~Attended robots operate with human interaction and are triggered by their user's emotions. Unattended robots operate without human intervention (they don't need no man)
    =Attended robots are trigerred by user events and operate along side humans. Unattended robots work alone in their virtual environment.
